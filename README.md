# To-do Backend Engineer

You're a new hire at a tech company that specializes in creating web applications.
They've just spent millions of dollars developing the hottest new TODO application.
Their backend engineers quit after a fire took their entire repository! The database
designers and frontend developers sit in anguish as their efforts are now futile.

The company is hoping that you can be their savior. The shareholders are going to be
livid when they find out about this catastrophe. Management wants to quickly rebuild
the backend layer to get the app into production before investors get upset. That's
where you come in!

Since the frontend is finished, its requirements are pretty clear. The Frontend
developers have helped by writing a series of automated tests to ensure that your
solution is going to work for the app!

To get started, clone your repository using the below command:

```bash
git clone https://jackjohn7/backend_todo_catastrophe
```

Feel free to research using search engines, but stay away from AI. Practicing traditional research
methods is worthwhile. A lot of companies discourage use of AI.
